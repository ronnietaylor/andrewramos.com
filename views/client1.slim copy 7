        | A small soap maker wanted to 
        | rebrand his company and tell 
        | the story of how organic his 
        | soaps were. Not 100% in fact. 
        | Say what? Since soap is a 
        | chemical reaction, it’s 
        | impossible to be pure organic. 
        | We wanted a name that kindly 
        | call out the other soap makers 
        | claiming to be 100% organic. 
        |
        | Enter the friendly, 
        | neighborhood apothacary to set 
        | the record straight. With 
        | phrases like “Any more organic 
        | and we’d be lying to you” he 
        | explains the difference and why 
        | this is Somewhat Organic.
